/* 
    Refined version of a program I made in 1st Year Uni.

    I am making this one in Rust since Java is awful to work with lol

    It will act as a game log for videogames, allowing users to:
    - Add 
    - Remove 
    - Search for games in the log
    
     Bringing up details on:
    - All playthroughs
    - Last Playthrough
    - Rating
    - Notes

fn main() {

    let message_for_lila = "fortnite";

    println!("{}", message_for_lila);
}
